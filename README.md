## Mission/Purpose:

This is a student led club designed to promote interest in the study of robotics and STEM through the teamwork of students, parents, mentors, and sponsors. We increase robotics and STEM awareness in our community and encourage education in engineering, computer science, web design, 3D animation, business, fundraising, and marketing. The club participates in robotics competitions, including ones organized by FIRST, an international robotics organization.

## Description:

The Stuyvesant Robotics Team is an organization dedicated to the practical application of science, technology, and business in the field of robotics. We undergo an intensive, but enjoyable, six-week build season during which we build a robot for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC).

Our engineering department designs and builds the hardware of the robot, from each of the mechanical components to the electronic and pneumatic systems.

Our software engineering department (the better department) develops the software used to control the robot as well as supporting software for the team.

Our business department provides real-world experience in non-profit fundraising and advertising as well as managing the logistics of a large team.

Our strategy team, comprised of members from all three departments, offers strategic assistance regarding robot design, gameplay, and alliance selections.

Our media team, comprised of members from all three departments, is led by the business department and is in charge of all media related matters (e.g. videos, pictures, etc.).

Our Inspiration Team, comprised of members from all three departments, is led by the business department and is in charge of all matters related to the "Impact Award" (e.g. presentation, essay, speech, outreach ideas, video ideas, etc.).

We require no prior experience at all in engineering, software engineering, business, strategy, media, or presenting and will teach the skills members need to be able to participate in FRC.

Membership on StuyPulse is unrestricted. The club does not restrict membership on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, commitment to other clubs, grade, or any other such factors. It is understood that those students who enjoy the club will attend and those who do not attend will not be considered members of the club.

## Charter Amendments:

The amendment process will begin sometime after the last competition of the school year. It is an open meeting, with the only requirement being that there must be at least two­-thirds of the Elected and Appointed Council present. All members who have paid their team dues, passed the safety test, written a reflection, and met a specific percentage of attendance may attend and vote. This percentage will be decided by the EC and faculty advisors. In the days leading up to the meeting, a list of eligible members shall be made public. Members who would like to propose charter amendments may submit proposals to the team in order to start discussion. Amendments not proposed prior to the meeting may be discussed at the end of the meeting if there is extra time.

The presidents of the team will preside over the charter meeting. They will decide on the order in which to address emailed proposals. Each proposal will be read and must be seconded to move to an initial vote to see where people stand. If the vote is unanimous, there will be no discussion or second vote. If there are conflicting views, members will be given time to discuss their thoughts on the issue. After discussion, the presidents will call for a final vote, where the majority decides the fate of the proposal. If the faculty advisor finds any issue with a part of the charter, there will be another charter meeting to revise the problematic parts.
The Moderator(s) of the charter meeting shall appoint a minutes taker. The minutes will be made publicly available to all members of the team, present at the charter meeting or otherwise.
The new Elected Council for the next school year will update the charter amendments in a timely manner and before the next charter meeting.

## Elections:

Elections will take place after the charter meeting each year. This is done in order to give the newly elected officials a chance to become familiar with the position and with the handling of the team. After members have been elected to their positions, they will appoint members to the AC. There is no term limit for any position, but candidates must run for election every year, whether or not there is any opposition. A member of the team who will no longer be a Stuyvesant student the following year or who is not eligible to vote may not run for any elected position.

### Rules for Elections:

- Elections will begin with a call of attendance, after which nobody may leave the room without permission and without filing an absentee ballot, assuming that member is eligible to vote.
- All members at or above a certain attendance percentage who have paid their team dues and have passed the safety test may attend and vote. This percentage will be decided by the EC and faculty advisors. Prior to the elections, a list of eligible members must be made available.
- An absentee ballot is an official ballot on which the person leaving writes down the name of one person for every position for which they wish to cast a vote. The ballot will be given to the person in charge of elections. If the absentee does not choose a candidate for a position, they are abstaining from the vote for that position.
- One team member, chosen by the Elected Council, will preside over elections as Moderator. They must uphold the rules, maintain order, and mediate any disputes that arise.

### Order of Elections:

The Presidents of each department must be elected before The Vice Presidents. The order of The Vice Presidents may be the reverse order of The Presidents, but it is at the discretion of the Moderator.

### Election Process:

The following election process will be followed for every position.

### Candidacy Announcement:

- Members must send out a candidacy email prior to elections in order to run for an elected position.
- A person becoming a senior in the following year may not run for vice presidency.
- A person may run for any position absentee if approved by two members of the current EC. The two members of the EC who approved the candidate will serve as one nomination for the candidate. This nomination must be seconded at the election by someone other than the two EC members who approved the absentee candidate.

### Candidate Presentations:

At the start of a position being spoken about, the moderator will share the candidates' attendance rate.

Each candidate is given up to four minutes to present his or her qualifications for the position. The order of the presentation will be determined by the members running the election.

### Discussion

A discussion will be held for each position following the presentations of those running for the position. The candidates are to be outside the room during the discussion period.

### Voting:

When the presentations are completed, all candidates will be asked to leave the room and voting will commence. Voting for a department's candidate will only be done by the department if that department has 9 or more members. Otherwise, the entire team will vote on that candidate. The current EC may vote for all department elections. Awards, Outreach, and Fundraising may vote for Business elections. I/T may vote for both SE and Business elections. The moderator may vote.

Students will rank their nominees in order of preference from 1 to however many they wish to put. The votes are sorted based on who they ranked first. If there is a clear majority, that individual wins the first nomination. If there is not a clear majority, the nominee with the fewest votes will be removed, and their votes will then be sorted based on the second choice listed on the ballot. This will keep occurring until one nominee has a clear majority.
After the first nominee is selected, the process is repeated with the same ballots to determine the second nominee.

- Ballots will be counted by the Moderator and one official mentor. Vote totals will not be made public to the team.
- Submitted ballots may only be viewed by the Moderator and the mentors. If another member of the team has intentionally viewed a ballot, that member will lose their right to vote for the remainder of the elections.
- If no member is nominated for a position, the position will become appointed.
- A “NONE” candidate is included in every election, including runoffs. If NONE wins the election, the position will become appointed.
- In the event of a tie after runoffs, the position will become appointed. Only the candidates who tied the vote may be appointed to the position, unless they are elected or appointed to another position first.
- A member may choose to abstain from voting during the election for any given position.
- If a candidate is running unopposed, then the voting process will be expedited with a limited question and answer period.
- If more than two candidates are running for a given position, the following will occur:
- Each member of the department or team will be given one vote to be cast towards a candidate. If a given candidate gets a majority vote, they will be immediately be appointed without a runoff. If no candidate gets a majority vote, the top two candidates will go into a runoff.
- If there is no majority vote or if only two members are nominated for a given position, the election automatically goes to a runoff.
- Every member of the department or team will vote for one of the two candidates and the candidate with the highest number of votes wins. If the case that a two-thirds majority of the members choose not to vote, the position will become appointed.
- In the case that no member is elected to any position, all present members of the current EC/AC will appoint the Presidents to represent the new EC/AC and follow the procedures of appointment.

## Appointment:

Any appointed position will be decided by a majority vote of the elected officers after the conclusion of the election. The member chosen may decline the appointment, in which case another member must be appointed.

In the case that a majority vote cannot be reached by the elected officers, appointment of that position will be delayed. After all other positions are filled, the EC/AC will vote on the appointed position again.
